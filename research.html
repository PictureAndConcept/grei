				<h3>Research</h3>

				<hr>
				<p>
					Mindful Yoga for Fertility Program is modeled after the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction course and Harvard Medical Instituteâ€™s Infertility Program. It incorporates the research of Jon Kabat-Zinn and Alice Domar, Ph.D, which shows that learning stress reduction techniques and connecting the body and mind within a supportive group environment can help with the emotional and physical symptoms caused by stress.</p>

				<h3>Some Facts</h3>
				
				<h4>Women who experience infertility are more likely to be depressed, anxious, and stressed</h4>

				<ul>

					<li> A study of 112 infertile women interviewed by a psychiatrist prior to treatment found 40 percent of these women showed symptoms of a depressive or anxiety disorder vs. 3 percent for the average population (Chen et al. 2004).
					</li>

					<li> Another study reported that, prior to IVF, 70 percent of women had mild to severe depressive symptoms (Demyttenaere et al. 1998).
					</li>

					<li> Eugster and Vingerhoets (1999) reviewed the literature on the psychological aspects of IVF. They conclude that beyond a doubt, IVF is physically and emotionally stressful for both women and their partners, with depression and anxiety as the most common reactions to treatment.
					</li>

					<li> Ending treatment after only one IVF cycle is more likely to occur in women who were determined to be more depressed and anxious before beginning treatment (Smeek, Verhaak, & Stolwijk, 2004).
					</li>

					<li> Several studies have indicated that a significant number of patients drop out of infertility treatment programs voluntarily, not for financial reasons or on the advice of their doctors. Many patients seeking help with infertility drop out due to "emotional cost." (Gleicher N, et al. 1996)
					</li>



				</ul>

<h4>Programs that focus on stress management and relaxation skills are effective in helping women cope with infertility.</h4>

				<ul>

					<li> Studies at Harvard Medical School on 184 women going through infertility treatments showed those who attended a 10-week mind/body program (included relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, and stress reduction), 55% had a viable pregnancy within one year. Compared to only 20% of the control group achieving a viable pregnancy in one year (Domar et al, April 2000).
					</li>

					<li> Clinical Research indicates 55% of women conceive after attending a mind body program." (Bruce Kessel, MD &Alice Domar, PhD 2004)
					</li>

					<li> Participation in Stress Management Program Results in Increased Pregnancy Rate - Women who participated in a stress management program prior to or during their second IVF cycle had a 160 percent greater pregnancy rate than women who did not participate in a program. The program was designed to educate women on the utilization of cognitive, relaxation and lifestyle techniques to manage stress. (Skillman, NJ, October 19, 2009)
